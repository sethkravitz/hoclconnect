Perfect—let’s harden the homepage for SEO without changing your design.

1) Tags to paste in <head>

Title + Meta

<title>HOCl Manufacturers (Bulk & Private Label) | HOCl Connect</title>
<meta name="description" content="Get matched with vetted hypochlorous acid (HOCl) manufacturers in the U.S. Choose bulk liquid or private label. Free matching, usually 1–3 business days." />
<link rel="canonical" href="https://hoclconnect.com/" />


Open Graph / Twitter

<meta property="og:description" content="We match you with verified hypochlorous acid suppliers for bulk or private label. Free, fast introductions." />
<meta property="og:url" content="https://hoclconnect.com/" />
<meta property="og:type" content="website" />
<meta property="og:image" content="https://hoclconnect.com/og/home.jpg" />
<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image" />


Organization + WebSite schema

<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context":"https://schema.org",
  "@type":"Organization",
  "name":"HOCl Connect",
  "url":"https://hoclconnect.com",
  "logo":"https://hoclconnect.com/logo.png"
}
</script>
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context":"https://schema.org",
  "@type":"WebSite",
  "url":"https://hoclconnect.com",
  "name":"HOCl Connect",
  "potentialAction":{
    "@type":"SearchAction",
    "target":"https://hoclconnect.com/search?q={query}",
    "query-input":"required name=query"
  }
}
</script>


FAQ schema (matches your on-page FAQ)

<script type="application/ld+json">
{
 "@context":"https://schema.org",
 "@type":"FAQPage",
 "mainEntity":[
  {"@type":"Question","name":"Do you manufacture or sell HOCl?",
   "acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"No. We are a free matching service that connects you to vetted HOCl manufacturers and private-label partners."}},

}

2) On-page SEO (keep visuals, add one accessible H1)

Your hero headline is great for conversion. Add a lightweight, visually hidden H1 so we capture the primary keyword without touching the layout:

<h1 class="sr-only">Find vetted hypochlorous acid (HOCl) manufacturers — bulk supply & private label</h1>


(Ensure .sr-only uses standard screen-reader utility: absolute clipped, 1px, etc.)

Internal links above the fold

“Get Bulk HOCl Liquid” → /bulk-hocl/

“Launch My Own HOCl Product” → /private-label-hocl/

Hero image/icon alt text

If decorative, alt="" role="presentation".

If not decorative, e.g., partner icons, give meaningful alt like alt="Vetted HOCl partners".

3) Copy micro-tweaks (fast edits)

Subhead (add the key term once):
“Whether you need hypochlorous acid (HOCl) bulk liquid or want to launch a private label product, we connect you to vetted partners.”

The small line under the orange CTA: include benefit + speed + clarity:
“Free matching • Usually 1–3 business days • We don’t manufacture HOCl.”

4) Navigation & footer links (minimal, helpful)

Header: Get Bulk HOCl · Private Label · How It Works · FAQ · Contact

Footer: repeat those + Privacy and Sitemap link to /sitemap.xml.

5) Form basics (conversion + data quality)

Use the same short form in the hero and lower CTA:

Name, Work Email, Company, Need: Bulk or Private-Label (radio), Monthly Volume band, Timeline.

Add hidden fields for utm_source, utm_medium, utm_campaign, utm_content.

Confirmation message: “Thanks—expect 1–3 introductions by email within 1–3 business days.”

6) Performance quick wins (single commit)

Convert hero/backgrounds to WebP/AVIF, preload the largest one.

rel="preconnect" to your font host; set font-display: swap.

Lazy-load all non-hero images: <img loading="lazy" …>

Minify CSS/JS; ensure no render-blocking 3rd-party scripts above the fold.

7) Indexing & tracking (homepage only for now)

Ensure homepage is not blocked; submit https://hoclconnect.com/ in GSC URL Inspection.

GA4: mark lead_form_submit as a conversion.
